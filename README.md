# Muskrat Discord Bot

## About

Muskrat is a Discord Bot that includes server moderation and management tools, as well as fun community building features. While built primarily for the needs of Musky Meadows (https://discord.gg/yZrpvEYuZy), Muskrat can benefit any server. Feel free to invite the bot to your own server and provide feedback so that he can continue to improve over time. The command prefix is `!!`, and you can type `!!help` to get started.

## Current Features

### Reaction Role Messages

In just a few simple steps, you can create messages that will give server members any role just by reacting with a certain emoji!

### Private Voice Channels

Muskrat allows anyone to make their own private Voice Channel lobby. Simply create a Voice Channel called "Create Private VC", and let Muskrat do all the work!

### Counting Channel

What discord bot would be complete without utilizing a `#counting` channel? Muskrat will ensure that all posts in `#counting` are a continuation of the counting chain, and will keep track of individual counters, so anyone can pull up the leaderboard and see how much they have counted.

### Around The World Channel

This feature works in a similar way to the counting channel, enforcing a chain of only the message "around the world" (and other variations of capitalization). Just set up a `#around-the-world` channel and Muskrat will take care of the rest!

### Joining and Leaving Servers

Muskrat will automatically welcome any new members to your server, send a customizable message, and give them a specified role upon joining. When someone leaves your server, Muskrat will notify you by sending a message in a specified channel

### Banned Words

Muskrat will automatically detect and remove messages if they contain any of a set of server-specific banned words/phrases.

### Logs

A vital part of any application is ensuring its users know what happens when something goes wrong, and what they can do to fix it. That's why Muskrat comes with a built in logging feature that will track any time something fails, and details as to what happened. You can also push your own text to the logs database if you want to record information for later.
